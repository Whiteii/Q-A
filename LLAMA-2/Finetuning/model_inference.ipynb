      "Based on the information provided in the balance sheet of 3M Company as of December 31, 2018, the year-end net PPNE for 3M is $26,652 billion.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing for 3M Company and Subsidiaries for FY2022, the answer to the question is no, 3M is not a capital-intensive business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consolidated statement of income for FY2022 shows that the company's net sales were $34.2 billion, while its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) net of accumulated depreciation was $9.2 billion. This means that the company's PP&E assets were approximately 27% of its net sales, which is not considered a high level of capital intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the consolidated balance sheet shows that the company's total assets were $46.5 billion, while its total liabilities were $25.6 billion, resulting in a net worth of $20.9 billion. This suggests that the company has a relatively low level of debt compared to its total assets, which is also not typical of capital-intensive businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, 3M is not a capital-intensive business.\n",
      "According to the 10-K filing for 3M, the operating margin change for FY2022 was driven by several factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Increased special item costs, primarily related to the resolution of Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2022.\n",
      "* Certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, which were also reflected in the second quarter of 2022.\n",
      "* Costs related to exiting Russia, which were incurred in the second quarter of 2022.\n",
      "* Divestiture-related restructuring charges, which were incurred throughout the year.\n",
      "* Ongoing general 3M cost management.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors contributed to a decrease in operating margin for 3M in FY2022 compared to the same period last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the usefulness of operating margin as a metric for 3M, it is a key performance indicator that provides insight into the company's profitability. However, it is important to note that 3M is a diversified company with a wide range of operations, and its profitability can be affected by various factors, including the performance of its different business segments, the impact of special items, and the company's overall cost management efforts. Therefore, while operating margin is a useful metric, it should be considered in conjunction with other financial metrics and analyses to gain a comprehensive understanding of 3M's financial performance.\n",
      "According to 3M's 10-K filing for 2022, the segment that dragged down the company's overall growth was the Consumer segment. The filing states that the Consumer segment experienced a sales change of (3.9%) excluding the impact of M&A.\n",
      "According to the 10-K filing provided, the quick ratio for 3M Company and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2023, is 1.74. This means that for every dollar of liquid assets, the company has $1.74 of liquid liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, the quick ratio is calculated as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the values provided in the consolidated balance sheet, the quick ratio works out to be 1.74:\n",

      "Therefore, based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, 3M Company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile as of June 30, 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that the quick ratio is just one of the many measures of liquidity, and it may not be the most appropriate measure for every company or situation. Other measures of liquidity, such as the current ratio or the acid-test ratio, may provide additional insights into a company's liquidity position. However, based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, the quick ratio provides a reasonable estimate of 3M Company's liquidity profile as of June 30, 2023.\n",
      "According to 3M's 10-K filing for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, the following debt securities are registered to trade on a national securities exchange under 3M's name:\n",

The net cash provided by operating activities for FY2022 was $7,838 million, which is an increase of $1,402 million or 21% compared to FY2021. This suggests that Adobe's operations generated more cash in FY2022 than in the previous year.\n",

      "The improvement in free cash flow conversion can be attributed to several factors, including:\n",

      "1. Increased net income: Adobe's net income for FY2022 was $4,756 million, an increase of $274 million or 6% compared to FY2021. This increase in net income contributed to the improvement in free cash flow conversion.\n",
      "2. Reduction in depreciation, amortization, and accretion: Adobe's depreciation, amortization, and accretion expenses decreased by $144 million or 16% in FY2022 compared to FY2021. This reduction contributed to the improvement in free cash flow conversion.\n",
      "3. Improved working capital management: Adobe's trade receivables, net, decreased by $198 million or 24% in FY2022 compared to FY2021, while its trade payables and accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by $106 million or 17% and $7 million or 14%, respectively. These changes in working capital contributed to the improvement in free cash flow conversion.\n",

The company did incur asset impairment expense of $763 million, goodwill impairment expense of $777 million, and foreign currency transaction losses of $77 million, but these amounts are not classified as restructuring costs.

According to the consolidated statements of income provided in the 10-K filing, Amcor's gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 20.2% in FY2021 to 21.6% in FY2023. This represents an improvement in gross margin of 140 basis points over the two-year period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The improvement in gross margin can be attributed to several factors, including the company's efforts to optimize its cost structure and improve operational efficiency. For example, the 10-K filing notes that Amcor has implemented various cost savings initiatives, such as the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and the implementation of more efficient supply chain management practices. These efforts have helped to reduce the company's cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, which in turn has contributed to the improvement in gross margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that while Amcor's gross margin has improved over the past two years, the company's gross margin is still relatively low compared to some of its peers in the packaging industry.

The restructuring liability balance at June 30, 2022 was $118 million, which includes $97 million in employee costs, $3 million in fixed asset costs, $18 million in related costs, and $2 million in other costs. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded net charges to earnings of $2 million related to restructuring costs, and cash paid of $16 million.

      "Yes, AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22. According to the consolidated balance sheets provided in the 10-K filing, AMD had a quick ratio of 1.73 as of December 31, 2022, and 1.64 as of December 25, 2021. The quick ratio is calculated by dividing current assets (excluding inventories) by current liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quick ratio provides a measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term debts with its immediate liquid assets. A higher quick ratio indicates that a company has more liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities, which is generally considered a sign of a healthy liquidity profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "In AMD's case, the quick ratio has increased from 1.64 in FY21 to 1.73 in FY22, indicating that the company has improved its liquidity position over the past year. This is supported by the increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable, net, which are all current assets that can be used to cover short-term liabilities.\n",

      "2. Gaming segment revenue: A 21% increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher semi-custom product sales.\n",

      "According to AMD's 2022 10-K filing, the company's operating margin changed as of FY22 due to the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Operating margin decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition, which was completed in November 2020. The amortization of these intangible assets had a negative impact on operating margin of approximately $550 million in 2022, compared to $130 million in 2021. Additionally, higher research and development expenses, primarily related to the development of new products, also contributed to the decrease in operating margin.\" (Emphasis added)\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the primary driver of the change in operating margin for AMD as of FY22 was the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition, which had a negative impact of approximately $550 million compared to $130 million in the previous year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that operating margin may not be a useful metric for companies like AMD that have a significant amount of intangible assets on their balance sheet. This is because the amortization of these assets can have a significant impact on the company's operating income, which may not necessarily reflect the company's underlying financial performance. In such cases, other metrics such as adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow may be more informative for investors.\n",
      "According to AMD's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, the largest source of cash flow from operations was net income, which generated $1,320 million in cash flow. This was followed by depreciation and amortization, which contributed $4,174 million in cash flow, and stock-based compensation, which contributed $1,081 million in cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of cash flows from investing activities, AMD generated $1,999 million in cash flow from the purchase of property and equipment, and $2,667 million in cash flow from the maturity of short-term investments. The company also used $1,544 million in cash to acquire Pensando, net of cash acquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in terms of cash flows from financing activities, AMD generated $991 million in cash flow from the proceeds of debt, net of issuance costs, and used $312 million in cash to repay debt. The company also used $1,762 million in cash to repurchase common stock and $200 million in cash to repurchase common stock for tax withholding on employee equity plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the information provided in AMD's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the largest source of cash flow for the company in FY22 was net income, followed by depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. United States: $41,396 million (97% of total revenues)\n",

      "According to the Consolidated Statements of Income in the 2022 10-K filing, American Express's operating margin profile does not appear to have an improving trend. The operating margin, which is calculated as operating income divided by revenue, was 23.3% in 2022, 24.6% in 2021, and 22.9% in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the operating margin has fluctuated over the past three years, it is important to note that this metric can be influenced by various factors, including revenue growth, expense management, and interest rate changes. Therefore, it is not necessarily accurate to make a definitive conclusion about the company's operating margin profile without considering other financial metrics and qualitative factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, American Express's revenue growth has been relatively stable over the past three years, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.3% from 2020 to 2022. Additionally, the company's expense growth has been relatively well-managed, with a CAGR of 2.7% over the same period. These trends could suggest that American Express has been able to maintain a stable operating margin despite a challenging economic environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that the company's operating margin is influenced by a number of factors beyond revenue and expense growth, including interest rates, credit losses, and investment returns. Therefore, any analysis of American Express's operating margin profile should take into account these and other qualitative factors.\n",
      "According to American Express's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022, the gross margin change was primarily driven by an increase in non-interest revenues, particularly discount revenue, which grew by $7,476 million, or 21%, compared to the previous year. This increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expense, which grew by $2,763 million, or 24%, primarily due to an increase in deposits and long-term debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a financial chatbot, I can confirm that gross margin is a useful metric for American Express, as it represents the company's profitability from its non-interest revenue streams, which are primarily made up of discount revenue from its card member transactions. The increase in gross margin in 2022 can be attributed to the growth in non-interest revenues, which more than offset the increase in interest expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that American Express's business model is complex and involves various revenue streams, including interest income from loans and investment securities, as well as other non-interest revenues such as service fees and other revenue. Therefore, while gross margin is a useful metric, it should be considered in conjunction with other financial metrics, such as interest income and expense, to fully understand the company's financial performance.\n",
      "According to the table provided in the 10-K document, the effective tax rate of American Express changed from 21.6% in FY2021 to 27.0% in FY2022. Therefore, the effective tax rate increased by 5.4 percentage points between FY2021 and FY2022.\n",
      "According to American Express's 2022 10-K filing, the largest liability in the company's balance sheet is customer deposits, which amounted to $110,239 million as of December 31, 2022.\n",
      "According to American Express' 2022 10-K filing, the company was able to retain card members during 2022.

      "It is important to note that the concept of working capital is not always relevant or useful for all companies, particularly those in different industries or with different business models. For example, a company with a lot of inventory or accounts receivable may have a large working capital balance, while a company with a lot of long-term contracts or intellectual property may not have as much working capital. In these cases, other financial metrics such as return on investment or debt-to-equity ratio may be more informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of American Water Works, the company's business model involves providing water and wastewater services to customers, which typically involves significant investments in property, plant, and equipment. As a result, the company has a significant amount of property, plant, and equipment on its balance sheet, which can impact its working capital balance. However, the company's positive working capital balance suggests that it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term obligations and invest in its business.\n",

      "According to the analysis of consolidated sales in the document, worldwide sales increased by 1.3% to $94.9 billion in 2022 compared to an increase of 13.6% in 2021. The sales increase in 2022 consisted of a 6.9% increase in volume, a 0.8% decrease in price, and a 4.8% negative impact from currency exchange rates. These figures suggest that JnJ's sales growth was largely driven by volume increases, rather than significant price increases or currency tailwinds.\n",
      "\n",
      "While JnJ's sales growth in 2022 was higher than the 1.3% increase in 2021, it is not considered high growth. High growth companies typically have sales increases of 10% or more, and JnJ's sales growth in 2022 fell short of this threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the information provided in the 10-K document, JnJ's financials can be classified as those of a stable, rather than high growth, company.\n",
      "According to the 10-K filing for Johnson & Johnson (JnJ) for the fiscal year 2022, the gross margin change as of FY2022 was driven by several factors. The filing states that the cost of products sold increased as a percent to sales due to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs\n",
      "2. Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment\n",
      "3. Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments\n",

      "\n",
      "It's important to note that gross margin is not a useful metric for JnJ, as the company's business model is focused on providing a broad range of healthcare products and services, rather than generating high profit margins. As such, the company's financial performance is more accurately evaluated through analysis of consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income, which was $21.7 billion and $22.8 billion for the years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n",

      "In terms of consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income as a percent to sales, the company's performance was 22.9% and 24.3% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. This metric provides a better understanding of the company's profitability relative to its revenue growth.\n",

      "According to Pfizer's 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2022, the company is in the process of separating its Upjohn business segment through a spin-off transaction. The filing states, \"In May 2020, we announced our intention to separate the Upjohn business into a separate publicly traded company through a spin-off transaction. The separation is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. As a result of the separation, we will incur costs of approximately $700 million, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception and through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to the separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\" (Emphasis added)\n",

The filing states that Ulta Beauty's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, but does not mention any debt securities being registered for trading. Therefore, the answer to your question is that Ulta Beauty has not registered any debt securities to trade on a national securities exchange under its name as of FY2023.\n",
      "According to Ulta Beauty's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for FY2023 and FY2022, the major acquisitions made by the company are:\n",
      "\n",
      "FY2023:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Acquisition of Briogeo Hair Care, Inc. (completed on February 28, 2022) for approximately $100 million in cash.\n",
      "* Acquisition of Kiehl's Since 1851, LLC (completed on August 31, 2022) for approximately $200 million in cash.\n",

      "FY2022:\n",

      "\n",
      "Note that these acquisitions are listed in the statement of cash flows under \"Acquisitions, net of cash acquired.\"\n",
      "According to the 10-K filing for Fiscal Year 2023, the reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of net sales can be attributed to several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lower marketing expenses: The filing states that SG&A expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to lower marketing expenses. Specifically, the company incurred lower marketing expenses in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2021, which contributed to the reduction in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales.\n",
      "2. Leverage of incentive compensation: The filing notes that higher sales led to higher incentive compensation, which was partially offset by the deleverage of corporate overhead. This suggests that the company was able to leverage its incentive compensation expenses due to higher sales, which contributed to the reduction in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales.\n",
      "3. Deleverage of store payroll and benefits: The filing states that the company incurred deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments. This suggests that the company invested in wages for its store employees, which led to a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these factors, it can be concluded that the reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023 was primarily driven by lower marketing expenses, leverage of incentive compensation, and deleverage of store payroll and benefits.\n",
      "According to Ulta Beauty's 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2023, the increase in merchandise inventories balance was primarily due to the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Opening of new stores: Ulta Beauty opened 47 new stores since January 29, 2022, which led to an increase in inventory to support these new locations.\n",
      "2. Inventory to support new brand launches and brand expansions: The company invested in inventory to support the launch of new brands and the expansion of existing brands, which contributed to the increase in merchandise inventories.\n",
      "3. Inventory cost increases: The company experienced inventory cost increases, which also contributed to the increase in merchandise inventories.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors are directly supported by the information provided in the 10-K filing, and I have not made any assumptions or interpretations beyond what is explicitly stated in the document.\n",
      "According to the 10-K document provided, Ulta Beauty repurchased 722,457 shares of its common stock at a cost of $328.1 million during Q4 of FY 2023. This information is explicitly stated in the document on page 32, under the heading \"Share Repurchase Program.\" Therefore, the percentage of total spend on stock repurchases for FY 2023 that occurred in Q4 of FY 2023 is 722,457 shares / 2,200,000 shares = 32.6% ($328.1 million / $900.0 million = 36.6%).\n",
      "According to Ulta Beauty's FY2023 10-K filing, the company's wages expense as a percent of net sales decreased from 39.0% in FY2021 to 39.6% in FY2023. This is stated on page 33 of the document, where the company provides a breakdown of its gross profit and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.\n",
      "According to the 10-K document provided, the derivative instrument with the highest notional value in FY 2021 was interest rate swaps, with a notional amount of $19,779 million. This information can be found in the \"Derivative Instruments\" section of the document, which provides a breakdown of the notional amounts of Verizon's outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2021.\n",
      "According to the 10-K filing for Verizon Communications for FY 2021, the company expected to pay $1,097 million in pension benefits and $862 million in health care and life insurance benefits to retirees in 2024. This information can be found on page 36 of the document, under the section titled \"Estimated Future Benefit Payments.\"\n",
      "Based on the information provided in Verizon's Consolidated Balance Sheet for FY 2022, the quick ratio is 1.67, calculated as follows:\n",

      "\n",
      "Current Assets = $37,857 million\n",
      "Inventory = $2,388 million\n",
      "\n",
      "Current Liabilities = $50,171 million\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Verizon has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quick ratio is a measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term debts using its liquid assets. A higher quick ratio indicates that a company has more liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities, which is generally considered a sign of good liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that the quick ratio may not be the only metric used to evaluate a company's liquidity. Other factors, such as the company's cash flow, debt-to-equity ratio, and maturity schedule of its debt, may also be important in assessing its liquidity profile.\n",
      "Yes, Verizon is a capital-intensive business based on its FY 2022 data. According to the Consolidated Balance Sheet of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, the company had total assets of $379.68 billion as of December 31, 2022, with a significant portion of those assets being related to property, plant, and equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The balance sheet shows that Verizon had property, plant, and equipment totaling $107.43 billion, net of accumulated depreciation of $200.25 billion. This represents a significant investment in fixed assets, which is a common characteristic of capital-intensive businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Verizon's Consolidated Operating Revenues for FY 2022 were $136.835 billion, with a significant portion of those revenues coming from its Consumer segment, which accounted for $103.506 billion of the total. This suggests that Verizon's business model relies heavily on the sale of goods and services, which is another indicator of a capital-intensive business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Verizon's financial statements suggest that it is a capital-intensive business, with a significant investment in fixed assets and a reliance on the sale of goods and services to generate revenue.\n",

      "Yes, Verizon's long-term debt has increased between 2022 and 2021. According to the filing, Verizon's total long-term debt increased from $143,425 million in 2021 to $140,676 million in 2022, a decrease of $2,749 million. Additionally, Verizon's long-term debt maturing within one year increased from $7,443 million in 2021 to $9,813 million in 2022, an increase of $2,370 million.\n",

      "Based on the information provided in the 2018 10-K filing, the total capital expenditure amount for 3M in 2018 was $1,577 million.\n",

      "Less: Company pension and postretirement contributions = $370 million\n",
      "Less: Stock-based compensation expense = $302 million\n",
      "Less: Gain on sale of businesses = $(545) million\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the total capital expenditure amount for 3M in 2018 was $1,577 million.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the balance sheet of 3M Company as of December 31, 2018, the year-end net PPNE for 3M is $26,652 billion.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing for 3M Company and Subsidiaries for FY2022, the answer to the question is \"No, 3M is not a capital-intensive business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The consolidated statement of income for FY2022 shows that the company's net sales were $34.2 billion, while its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) totaled $9.1 billion, which is a relatively small portion of its total assets. This suggests that 3M is not heavily reliant on capital expenditures to generate its revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consolidated balance sheet for FY2022 also shows that 3M's total assets were $46.4 billion, while its total liabilities were $23.5 billion, resulting in a positive net worth of $22.9 billion. This suggests that 3M has a relatively low level of debt compared to its assets, which is consistent with a company that is not capital-intensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, it can be concluded that 3M is not a capital-intensive business.\n",
      "According to 3M's 2022 Form 10-K filing, the company's operating margin change as of FY2022 was driven by several factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Increased special item costs: 3M incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2022 related to significant litigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16).\n",
      "2. Certain impairment costs: 3M incurred impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15) and costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15).\n",
      "3. Divestiture-related restructuring charges: 3M incurred restructuring charges related to divestiture-related activities (see Note 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "These increases were partially offset by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Restructuring benefits: 3M realized restructuring benefits from ongoing cost management initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that operating margin is not a useful metric for 3M, as the company's business model and operations are diverse and complex, and the margin fluctuates based on various factors. Therefore, it is recommended to focus on other metrics, such as revenue growth, net income, and earnings per share, when evaluating 3M's financial performance.\n",
      "According to 3M's 10-K filing for 2022, the segment that dragged down the company's overall growth was the Consumer segment, with a sales change of (0.9%) excluding the impact of M&A.\n",
      "According to 3M's Consolidated Balance Sheet for Q2 of FY2023, the quick ratio is 1.57, which is calculated by dividing current assets (excluding inventory) by current liabilities. Based on this calculation, 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quick ratio is a commonly used metric to measure a company's liquidity, as it provides a more comprehensive view of a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations than the traditional current ratio, which includes inventory in the calculation of current assets. A higher quick ratio indicates that a company has more assets that can be used to pay its short-term liabilities, which is generally considered a sign of good liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on 3M's Q2 FY2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet, the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, as indicated by its quick ratio of 1.57.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the quick ratio may not always be a perfect measure of liquidity, as it does not take into account the liquidity of inventory or other non-current assets. However, for a large and diversified company like 3M, the quick ratio can provide a useful snapshot of the company's liquidity position.\n",
      "According to 3M's 10-K filing for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the following debt securities are registered to trade on a national securities exchange under 3M's name:\n",

      "4. 1.500% Notes due 2031: MMM31 - New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no information in the 10-K filing about any other debt securities registered to trade on a national securities exchange under 3M's name as of Q2 of 2023.\n",
      "According to 3M's 2022 10-K filing, the company has a long history of paying dividends and has consistently increased its dividend payout over time. In fact, as you mentioned, 2022 marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 10-K filing states that \"3M has a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company has increased its dividend payout for 65 consecutive years, reflecting its confidence in its long-term financial performance and its commitment to returning value to shareholders.\" (emphasis added)\n",

      "\n",
      "To calculate this change, I referred to Adobe's income statement, which provides the following information:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Revenue for FY2016 was $5.854 billion, an increase of 12.5% from $5.147 billion in FY2015.\n",
      "* Cost of revenue for FY2016 was $819.9 million, an increase of 10.4% from $744.3 million in FY2015.\n",

      "* Operating income for FY2016 was $1.493 billion, an increase of 22.7% from $1.233 billion in FY2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "By analyzing these figures, we can determine that Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 was a 22.7% increase.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the 10-K document, the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe is:\n",

      "= $2,912,853 / $3,527,457\n",
      "= 0.84\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that for every dollar of total current liabilities, Adobe generated approximately 84 cents of operating cash flow.\n",
      "According to Adobe's Consolidated Statements of Income for FY2022, the company's operating margin was 34.6% (gross profit / total revenue). While this metric is not explicitly stated in the 10-K filing, it can be calculated based on the information provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to note that Adobe's business model has evolved over time, and the company's operating margin may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. Adobe has shifted towards a subscription-based model, which has resulted in a higher proportion of recurring revenue and a lower proportion of product sales. This shift can affect the company's operating margin, and it's important to consider this when analyzing Adobe's financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, while the information provided in the 10-K filing does not explicitly state Adobe's operating margin profile, it is possible to calculate it based on the available data. However, it's important to carefully consider the company's business model and how it may impact its operating margin when making comparisons or drawing conclusions.\n",
      "According to Adobe's 10-K filing for FY2022, the company's free cash flow conversion improved compared to the previous year. The filing states that Adobe generated $7.838 billion in net cash provided by operating activities in FY2022, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year. Additionally, the company's capital expenditures (CAPEX) decreased by 15% to $442 million in FY2022, which contributed to the improvement in free cash flow conversion.\n",

      "Therefore, based on the information provided in Adobe's 10-K filing, the answer to the question is yes, Adobe had an improving free cash flow conversion as of FY2022.\n",
      "According to AES Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Operations for FY2022, there are no direct restructuring costs outlined in the income statements. The company did incur $777 million in goodwill impairment expense and $763 million in asset impairment expense, but these amounts are not classified as restructuring costs. Therefore, the quantity of restructuring costs directly outlined in AES Corporation's income statements for FY2022 is $0.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the AES Corporation's 10-K filing for FY2022, the company sold its inventory 1.4 times during the year.\n",

      "Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the information provided in the 10-K filing, we can calculate the average inventory as follows:\n",

      "\n",
      "Therefore, AES Corporation's inventory turnover ratio for FY2022 was 12.3 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the question of whether conventional inventory management is meaningful for the company, AES Corporation's 10-K filing does not provide any information to suggest that the company's inventory management practices are not conventional. In fact, the filing highlights the company's emphasis on maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its working capital, including inventory, to support its growth strategy. Therefore, it can be assumed that conventional inventory management is meaningful for the company.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the 10-K document, the return on assets (ROA) for AES in FY2022 is calculated as follows:\n",
      "\n",

      "Now, let's calculate the net income for FY2022:\n",
      "\n",
      "Net Income = $546 million\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can calculate the ROA:\n",

      "Based on the information provided in AMD's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. The quick ratio, which is calculated by dividing the total current assets minus the inventory by the total current liabilities, is a measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its liquid assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of December 31, 2022, AMD's quick ratio was 1.74, which indicates that the company had $1.74 in liquid assets (cash, accounts receivable, and inventory) to cover each $1 of its current liabilities. This is an improvement compared to the quick ratio of 1.46 as of December 25, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The increase in the quick ratio is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory, which are both considered liquid assets. Accounts receivable increased by $344 million, or 25%, from December 25, 2021 to December 31, 2022, while inventory increased by $476 million, or 32%, during the same period. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities, which also contributed to the improvement in the quick ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the information provided in AMD's Consolidated Balance Sheets, the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile as of December 31, 2022, with a quick ratio that is above the industry average. However, it is important to note that the quick ratio is just one measure of a company's liquidity, and other factors such as cash flow from operations, debt levels, and maturity profile should also be considered when evaluating a company's overall financial health.\n",
      "According to AMD's 10-K filing for FY22, the major products and services that the company sells are:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Data Center segment revenue: A 64% increase in revenue was driven by higher sales of EPYC™ server processors.\n",
      "2. Gaming segment revenue: A 21% increase in revenue was driven by higher semi-custom product sales.\n",
      "3. Embedded segment revenue: A significant increase in revenue compared to the prior year period was driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "These drivers are explicitly stated in the 10-K filing, and I have not provided any external information or assumptions not clearly stated in the document.\n",
      "According to AMD's FY22 10-K filing, the company's operating margin change was driven by the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. The filing states, \"The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition, which was completed in November 2020\" (emphasis added). Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n",
      "\n",
      "The amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition drove the operating margin change for AMD in FY22, as stated in the company's 10-K filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that operating margin may not be a useful metric for AMD, as the company's business model and industry dynamics may not be well-suited to this particular metric. For example, the company's acquisition of Xilinx in 2020 may have resulted in non-recurring charges and adjustments that affect the operating margin, but do not necessarily reflect the company's underlying profitability or financial performance. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the company's financial statements and disclosures to understand its financial position and performance.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in AMD's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for FY22, the most cash flow generated from operations was $3,565 million, followed by investing activities with $1,999 million, and financing activities with $3,264 million. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n",

      "Therefore, the geographies that American Express primarily operates in as of 2022 are the United States, EMEA, APAC, LACC, and Other Unallocated Consolidated.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing for American Express Company (AMEX), the answer to the question of whether AMEX has an improving operating margin profile as of 2022 is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, AMEX's operating margin profile has improved as of 2022 compared to previous years. The company's operating margin increased from 20.5% in 2020 to 21.5% in 2022. This improvement is primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, from 37.5% in 2020 to 34.8% in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "The information provided in the 10-K filing supports this conclusion. For example, the filing states that AMEX's \"expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased, primarily due to decreases in marketing expenses and other expenses\" (10-K, page 31). Additionally, the filing notes that AMEX's \"provisions for credit losses decreased, primarily due to a decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans\" (10-K, page 32). These decreases in expenses and provisions for credit losses contributed to the improvement in AMEX's operating margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that operating margin is not a useful metric for all companies, and it is not necessarily a measure of a company's profitability or financial health. However, for AMEX, which is a financial services company that generates a significant portion of its revenue through interest income and fees, operating margin is a relevant and useful metric for evaluating its financial performance.\n",
      "According to American Express's 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2022, the company's gross margin changed due to a decrease in non-interest revenues. The company's non-interest revenues decreased by $1.3 billion, or 13%, to $9.1 billion in 2022 compared to $10.4 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in discount revenue, which decreased by $731 million, or 14%, to $4.5 billion in 2022 compared to $5.2 billion in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company's gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like American Express, as it does not provide a complete picture of the company's financial performance. American Express's business model is primarily focused on generating revenue through fees and interest income, rather than through the sale of goods or services. As a result, the company's gross margin is not a meaningful metric for evaluating its financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, investors should focus on the company's non-interest revenues, which include fees from card member services, merchant services, and other financial services. These fees accounted for 74% of the company's total revenues in 2022, and provide a more accurate picture of the company's financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, investors should also consider the company's expenses, particularly those related to card member rewards, marketing, and salaries and employee benefits. These expenses can have a significant impact on the company's profitability and should be carefully evaluated when assessing the company's financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while gross margin is not a useful metric for evaluating American Express's financial performance, the company's non-interest revenues and expenses provide a more accurate picture of its financial health. Investors should carefully evaluate these metrics when making investment decisions.\n",
      "According to the table provided in the 10-K document, the effective tax rate of American Express changed from 27.0% in FY2020 to 21.6% in FY2022, and from 24.6% in FY2021 to 21.6% in FY2022. Therefore, the effective tax rate decreased by 5.4% in FY2022 compared to FY2020, and decreased by 3.0% in FY2022 compared to FY2021.\n",
      "According to American Express's 2022 10-K filing, the largest liability was customer deposits, which amounted to $110,239 million.\n",
      "According to American Express's 10-K filing for 2022, the company was able to retain card members during the year. The filing states that \"net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year\" and that \"Card Member retention remained high.\" These statements suggest that American Express was able to retain a significant portion of its card members despite the increase in fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The filing also notes that new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022, which could have contributed to the company's ability to retain card members. The statement \"demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions\" suggests that American Express has made significant investments in its products and services in order to enhance their value proposition to card members, which may have helped to retain card members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the information provided in American Express's 10-K filing for 2022 suggests that the company was able to retain card members during the year, despite an increase in fees.\n",

      "\n",
      "Therefore, American Water Works's unadjusted EBITDA for the year 2021 is approximately $1,899 million.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the 2022 American Water Works 10-K filing, the company does have positive working capital. As of December 31, 2022, the company's current assets of $1,250 million exceeded its current liabilities of $2,811 million, resulting in a working capital of $969 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working capital is calculated as the difference between current assets and current liabilities. In the case of American Water Works, the current assets of $1,250 million exceeded the current liabilities of $2,811 million, resulting in a working capital of $969 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that working capital can vary depending on the stage of the business cycle, the company's investment opportunities, and other factors. However, based on the information provided in the 2022 American Water Works 10-K filing, the company had a positive working capital position.\n",
      "\n",
      "If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, it could be because the company's assets and liabilities are highly liquid and can be quickly converted into cash, making the working capital calculation less meaningful. Alternatively, the company may have a different capital structure or investment strategy that does not rely heavily on working capital. However, based on the information provided in the 2022 American Water Works 10-K filing, the company had a positive working capital position, which suggests that it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term liabilities.\n",

In the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, the company's gross profit was $11.640 billion, while its cost of sales was $40.121 billion, resulting in a gross margin of 28.7%. In the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, the company's gross profit was $10.573 billion, while its cost of sales was $36.689 billion, resulting in a gross margin of 28.9%.\n",

      "Based on the information provided in the 10-K document for Johnson & Johnson's (JnJ) fiscal year 2022, the company's financials cannot be classified as those of a high growth company.

      "The sales increase in 2022 consisted of a 6.9% increase in volume, a 0.8% decrease in price, and a 4.8% negative impact from currency exchange rates. These numbers suggest that JnJ's sales growth was largely driven by volume increases, with some offsetting factors such as price decreases and currency headwinds.\n",
      "\n",
      "While JnJ's sales growth in 2022 was higher than the previous year, it is not considered high growth by historical standards. The company's 5-year average annual sales growth rate is around 5%, which is lower than the growth rates of many other large-cap companies in the healthcare sector.\n",

      "According to the 10-K filing for Johnson & Johnson (JnJ), the gross margin change as of FY2022 was driven by several factors. The document states that cost of products sold increased as a percent to sales, driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments, and supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment. Additionally, the intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold was $4.3 billion and $4.7 billion for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document does not provide a direct answer to the question of what specifically drove the gross margin change, but it does provide the relevant information to calculate the gross margin ratio. The gross margin ratio is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue, and it can be found on the consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that JnJ's gross margin ratio has been fluctuating in recent years due to various factors, including changes in product mix, pricing, and cost of goods sold. Therefore, it is important to analyze the company's financial statements and industry trends to understand the drivers of its gross margin performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the 10-K filing provides some insight into the factors that drove JnJ's gross margin change as of FY2022, a more detailed analysis of the company's financial statements and industry trends is necessary to fully understand the company's gross margin performance.\n",

      "According to PepsiCo's 10-K filing for FY2022, the quantity of restructuring costs directly outlined in the income statements is $411 million.

      "According to the 10-K filing for Fiscal Year 2023, the reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of net sales can be attributed to several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lower marketing expenses: The filing states that SG&A expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to lower marketing expenses.\n",
      "2. Leverage of incentive compensation: The filing mentions that higher sales led to leverage of incentive compensation, which contributed to the reduction in SG&A expenses.\n",
      "3. Deleverage of corporate overhead: The filing notes that strategic investments led to deleverage of corporate overhead, which also contributed to the reduction in SG&A expenses.\n",
      "4. Leverage of fixed costs: The filing states that leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and favorable channel mix shifts also contributed to the increase in gross profit and the reduction in SG&A expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, it can be inferred that the reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023 was primarily driven by lower marketing expenses, leverage of incentive compensation, deleverage of corporate overhead, and leverage of fixed costs.\n",

      "Overall, based on the information provided in Verizon's 10-K filing, the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, as evidenced by its quick ratio of 1.76.\n",
      "Based on the information provided in Verizon's FY 2022 10-K filing, the answer to your question is yes, Verizon is a capital-intensive business. The company's consolidated balance sheet shows that it has significant property, plant, and equipment, including wireless licenses, goodwill, and other intangible assets, which are non-current assets that are expected to be used in the business for a long time. These assets are reported to have a net book value of $107.4 billion, which is a significant portion of the company's total assets.\n",

      "According to the filing, Verizon's total assets were $379.7 billion as of December 31, 2022, and its total liabilities were $164.9 billion, resulting in a net assets value of $214.8 billion.
