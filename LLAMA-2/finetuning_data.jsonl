As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned\r\nsubsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium\u2019s lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that\r\nis designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\r\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the\r\ngross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired\r\nIPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is\r\npresented as a cash outflow from operating activities.
