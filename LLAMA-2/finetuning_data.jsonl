Trillium\u2019s lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that\nis designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the\ngross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired\nIPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is\npresented as a cash outflow from operating activities.

In addition, $157 million in payments to\nArray employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded\nin Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3).
