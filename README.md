# Anote_Q-A
 
# What was the primary objective of the project with Anote AI?
Our main goal was to enhance the performance and accuracy of question-answering capabilities in models like GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 All, Claude, and LLAMA. Historically, these models required substantial labeled data for optimal performance, and analyzing real-world data posed challenges due to its unstructured nature.

# How did you address these challenges?
We adopted an active learning strategy tailored for question-answering tasks. By continually providing labeled examples and fine-tuning these models with human feedback, we significantly improved their proficiency in answering questions accurately and effectively outperforming without any label example.
