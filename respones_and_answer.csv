"The document provided does not include a balance sheet nor any mention of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net (PPNE) for 3M in fiscal year 2018 (FY2018). Therefore, I'm unable to provide the requested information.",$8.70
"Based on the FY2022 data, 3M does appear to be a capital-intensive business. This statement is supported by the significant amount of money the company spent on capital projects, which includes $317 million on environmental capital projects, as well as total company capital spending of $1,749 million. Additionally, the company is planning to increase capital expenditures to approximately $646 million for 2023 and 2024 in aggregate for similar environmental projects. Furthermore, 3M's investment in property, plant, and equipment also suggests a high level of capital intensity, as they spent considerable amounts for these assets across all geographical regions (Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa).","No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:
CAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%
Fixed assets/Total Assets: 20%
Return on Assets= 12.4%"
"The operating income margin for 3M for the year ended 2022 was 19.1%. The change in the operating margin was primarily driven by several factors. Increases in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, were primarily due to 2022 special item costs for significant litigation from additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher raw materials and logistics costs, and manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and progress on restarting previously-idled operations, as well as investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability. These increases were partially offset by increases in selling prices. Additionally, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased, measured as a percent of net sales, from 20.4% in 2021 to 26.5% in 2022. The company is also continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, which is impacting the cost of sales, SG&A, and Research & Development (R&D) expenses. Consequently, these factors led to the decrease in the operating income margin from 20.8% in 2021 to 19.1% in 2022.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges"

"The text provided does not contain enough information to calculate the FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard. The information required: FY2019 revenue, and the average property, plant, and Equipment (PP&E) between FY2018 and FY2019 is not given in the text.",24.26
"The statement of income shows net revenues of $7,017 million for 2017, $7,500 million for 2018, and $6,489 million for 2019. The cash flow statement shows capital expenditures of $155 million for 2017, $131 million for 2018, and $116 million for 2019. 

Therefore, capex as a percent of revenue can be calculated as follows:

- 2017: (155 / 7,017) * 100 = 2.21%
- 2018: (131 / 7,500) * 100 = 1.75%
- 2019: (116 / 6,489)* 100 = 1.79%

To find the average over the three years, add these percentages together and then divide by three: 

(2.21 + 1.75 + 1.79) / 3 = 1.92%. Therefore, the three-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019 is approximately 1.9%.",1.9%

Substituting the given values into the formula will give us: [(1,493,602-903,095)/903,095]*100 = 65.4%. Therefore, the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is approximately 65.4%.",65.4%
"The cash from operations for Adobe in 2016 is $2,199,728 thousand and the total current liabilities is $2,811,635 thousand. Thus, the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe for 2016 is 2,199,728/2,811,635 = 0.78.",0.83

"From the condensed financial information provided, AES's FY2022 net income is $(546) million. The total assets for FY2022 and FY2021 are $7,575 million and $7,525 million, respectively. Therefore, the average total assets between FY2021 and FY2022 is the sum of these two values divided by 2, which is $(7,575 + 7,525) / 2 = $7,550 million. 

Return on Assets (ROA) is calculated as below:

ROA = FY2022 Net Income / Average Total Assets between FY2021 and FY2022

"The 10-K document does not provide explicit detail on whether Boeing has an improving gross margin profile for fiscal year 2022. However, it shows increases in ""earnings from operations"" for its Global Services segment (from $450 million in 2020, $2,017 million in 2021 to $2,727 million in 2022). The operating margin percentages also improved (from 2.9% in 2020, 12.4% in 2021 to 15.5% in 2022).

The document did mention that the 767, 777X, and 787 programs had near break-even or single digit margins at December 31, 2022 and that adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods.

However, the gross margin may be less useful for a company like Boeing because it follows a method of accounting called program accounting. This method averages out the costs and revenues of producing an aircraft model over the model's production life, which means the reported costs in any single period may not accurately reflect the actual number of aircraft completed and delivered in that period. Moreover, manufacturing commercial aircraft involves significant upfront development costs which get spread over numerous units and years, making gross margin less reflective of the company's performance in a particular period. It's also important to consider other factors such as the performance of different business segments, changes in production levels, and specific issues related to individual programs.","Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022."
"The primary customers of Boeing as of FY2022 include the commercial airline industry worldwide, for the Commercial Airplanes Segment, and the U.S. government for the Defense, Space & Security Segment and Global Services. In particular, the U.S. government represents over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Boeing Capital segment customers primarily comprise those needing customer financing and investments. The document also mentions that access to global markets is vital for Boeing's sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.",Boeing's primary customers as of FY2022 are a limited number of commercial airlines and the US government. The US government accounted for 40% of Boeing's total revenues in FY2022.
The 10-K document does not provide specific information on whether Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality.,"Yes, Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality due to its exposure to the airline industry which is a cyclical industry."
"Boeing is forecasting the following production rate changes for FY2023:

1. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and is expected to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023.

"The operating income for Corning Incorporated for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, according to the given document, were $1,306 million, $509 million, and $2,112 million respectively. The corresponding net sales for these years were $11,503 million, $11,303 million, and $14,082 million.

To calculate the operating income % margin for each year, we divide the operating income by the net sales and then multiply by 100.

For 2019: ($1,306 / $11,503) * 100 = 11.4%
For 2020: ($509 / $11,303) * 100 = 4.5%
For 2021: ($2,112 / $14,082) * 100 = 15.0%

Now, the three-year average unadjusted operating income % margin is calculated by taking the average of the operating income % margins for the three years.

Average = (11.4 + 4.5 + 15.0) / 3 = 10.3%

Hence, the FY2019 - FY2021 3 year average unadjusted operating income % margin for Corning is approximately 10.3%.",10.3%

"The unadjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales for Walmart in FY2018 was 4.1%. In FY2019, it was 4.3%. Therefore, the FY2018 - FY2019 change in unadjusted operating income % margin for Walmart is 0.2%.",0.2%
"In order to calculate the average unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Walmart for FY2018 - FY2020, we need to first calculate the EBITDA for each year and then divide it by the net sales for the respective year. The formula for EBITDA is unadjusted operating income + depreciation and amortization.

From the Profit & Loss Statement:
Operating Income for FY2020 = $20,568 million
Operating Income for FY2019 = $21,957 million
Operating Income for FY2018 = $20,437 million

From the Cash Flow Statement:
Depreciation and Amortization for FY2020 = $10,987 million
Depreciation and Amortization for FY2019 = $10,678 million
Depreciation and Amortization for FY2018 = $10,529 million 

From the Profit & Loss Statement:
Net Sales for FY2020 = $519,926 million
Net Sales for FY2019 = $510,329 million
Net Sales for FY2018 = $495,761 million

EBITDA calculations:
EBITDA for FY2020 = Operating Income FY2020 + Depreciation and Amortization FY2020 = $20,568 million + $10,987 million = $31,555 million
EBITDA for FY2019 = Operating Income FY2019 + Depreciation and Amortization FY2019 = $21,957 million + $10,678 million = $32,635 million
EBITDA for FY2018 = Operating Income FY2018 + Depreciation and Amortization FY2018 = $20,437 million + $10,529 million = $30,966 million

EBITDA % Margin:
EBITDA % Margin for FY2020 = (EBITDA FY2020 / Net Sales FY2020) x 100 = (31,555 / 519,926) x 100 = 6.07%
EBITDA % Margin for FY2019 = (EBITDA FY2019 / Net Sales FY2019) x 100 = (32,635 / 510,329) x 100 = 6.39%
EBITDA % Margin for FY2018 = (EBITDA FY2018 / Net Sales FY2018) x 100 = (30,966 / 495,761) x 100 = 6.25%

The three years average unadjusted EBITDA % margin = (6.07% + 6.39% + 6.25%) / 3 = 6.24%. Rounds to 6.2% in the one decimal place.
