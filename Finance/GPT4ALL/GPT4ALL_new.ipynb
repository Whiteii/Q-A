The statement of financial position provides information about the company's assets and liabilities at a specific point in time, while the cash flow statement shows how much cash is being generated or used by the business over a period of time. \n",

      "Sure, I can help you with that! Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is $349 million or 7.8% (rounded to one decimal place). The company had a total revenue of $8.6 billion and an adjusted operating income of $3.2 billion for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2016. To calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income, we need to subtract the prior-year's operating income from the current-year's operating income and then divide it by the total revenue. This calculation gives us a percentage value that represents the change in operating income over the previous year.\n",

Total current liabilities include accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other short-term debts. \n",

In the most recent fiscal year, Adobe's operating margin was approximately 31%. This represents a significant increase from the company's operating margin in the previous fiscal year, which was only around 9%. Additionally, Adobe has made commitments to improve its operating margins further through initiatives such as cost optimization and revenue growth. Therefore, it can be concluded that Adobe is making progress towards improving its operating margin profile.\n",
