These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal\\ntheories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___In December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee (“PEC”). The agreement would resolve substantially all\\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys’ fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. \\n\\n### Response: Yes, CVS Health has been involved in multiple ongoing legal battles. Some notable legal dispute areas for CVS are: (1) usual and customary pricing litigation: where it's claimed that CVS’s retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs; (2) PBM litigation and investigations: where it's claimed that that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products; and (3) controlled substances litigation: legal matters around opioids for which CVS has agreed to pay up to $4.3 billion to claimants in remediation and $625 million to attorneys and fees\"},\n",
